## My process

### Built with

- Astro
- Svelte
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## Optimizations / Fixes

- the navbar shows up from the right, should probably come from the left side or the top, wasn't sure about that
- fix responsiveness, so far only good for 1440 and 375px screens, some sizes in between break
